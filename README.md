## What is this?
  SMS is Smart library Management System
  
## Motivation
Reading room is a public space. Existing reading room systems don’t provide efficient time distribution. When user occupies seat and leaves for a long time, anyone can’t access this seat and this seat is going to waste. This is waste of limited resources (user’s time, seat, etc…). Current reading room systems can’t manage this problem. Current library application in Ajou, just provides service about only extending time of seat once a day. We will manage this problem and improve current reading room system.

## Project Goal
We ameliorate the existing problems in library and that would be suitable for real situation. The different things of S.M.S produce better environments for students to share a temporary empty seat and also have seat reservation function. so, it will prevent a waste of limited seats. Moreover, The program gives penalty to user who didn't require to leave, extend, loan and finally the program can make better library conditions. normally, people can not express their dissatisfaction to rude manner library users. For this, we offer compaint function. Through this kind of function, this system can create better managing library about the above problem.
